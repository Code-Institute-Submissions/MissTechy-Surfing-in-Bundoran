"# Surfing-in-Bundoran" 
https://misstechy.github.io/Surfing-in-Bundoran/
Loving extreme sports I created a website about Bundoran Surf CO. Surfing was one of the first activities I tried in my first year in Ireland, and it was not the only one booked with Bundoran Surf.

I loved the atmosphere, scenary and diversity of people so much that I helped them with organising some trips and also DJ-ing for everyone.

Surfing in Bundoran will forever remain a good memory and here I am trying to represent them in my project.

UX
I had a look over Bundoran's Surfing website :https://bundoransurfco.com/welcome-to-bundoran-surf-mobile/ . It looked crowded and unorganized.

Having the chance to experience their services I build an easy, predictable and user friendly website.

I built my wireframes manually using old fashioned pen and papper. And I highlighted the following:
-user friendly and responsive menu;
-gallery pictures to tease the user;
-jumbotron with large social media icons for the user to be tempted to follow and subscribe;
-short introduction about Surfing team in Bundoran and their motivation;
-reviews and feedback as they are extremly important to have on the website;
-packages and services offered had to be visible and user-interactive as well as the prices;
-and of course the footer that has the same details on each page;

As a sales person and also a consummer I always look for the design, content, understanding the information, social media for proof of fun/services, phone number and address.

I believe that the entire project offers enough information to make the user make a choice. And those are photos, links to social media, shop and Sea Sessions Festival, as well as a sign up page.

Tools used:
-Bootstrap:menu, carousel images, sticky jumbotron, grid, gallery interactive images, cards (for reviews and prices) and sign up/sign in;
-Debbugging with: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input;
-Beautifying with: https://webformatter.com/html;
-Image compression so they can load faster: https://tinypng.com;
-Icons taken from:https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=surf;
-Images, logos and package prices taken from: https://bundoransurfco.com;


Features
Menu, Carousel img, Jumbotron - Menu Page
-I thought this 3 work nicely together. 
The Menu expands when the screen is large and all pages get inside the Menu square whn the screen size is small. I was looking for a minimalist approach in this case.

Carousel Images -Menu Page
I added 3 images to encapsulate and tease the viewar, such as:how cool people can look with the surf boards, the surf shop, and Sea Sessions Festival Poster that Bundoran Surf partnered with. Also to tease more The button on the first page directs the user to a youtube Intro for Bundoran Surf CO.
All seams statc but the links redirect users to emotional trigers and that was my aim.

Jumbotron - Menu Page
The large icons suppose to encourage the user to click on them and find more proof of fun after clicking on the video button. The Jumbotron bar remains the same size on each page so the user can interact with it antime he wants. Large enaough to not miss it.

...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
