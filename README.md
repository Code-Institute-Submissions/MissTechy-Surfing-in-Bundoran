<b>First Time Visitor Goals</b>

1.As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice (home page, gallery page, services page and sign up page). Underneath there is a carousel image with Text and a "video" Calling to action button. The button takes you to Bundoran Surf Youtube page where users can see their promo video.
Underneath the carousel images there is an "About Us" section describing the team, their passion and the goals, and also a hyper link with the Sea sessions Festival.
